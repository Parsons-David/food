## Notes

### Attempt 1 - 1/22/19

**Cooking Notes:**

Cauliflower
  - Found success pulling the heads apart from the roots instead of trying to pull from the top.

Mixing
  - Adding Cauliflower to mix from step 2 was kinda a pain in the ass. Maybe consider adding some light oil to the cauliflower to make mixing easier.
  - Overall kinda a pain in the ass, but worked out pretty well.

Coconut/Vegetable Oil
  - Coconut oil was hella expensive, so we just ended up using Olive Oil

Hot Sauce
  - We used Franks Red Hot Wings Sauce

**Taste Notes:**
Tasted alot like Chicken Wings in initial texture, just with a veggie internal texture.

Sauce was very good standalone, could go well with other things

**Report & Tips**

Good enough that ate it all. Tasted like Veggie Chicken Wings.

Next time it'd be cool to try coconut oil, but it is hella expensive

Could probably get away without the Parchment paper, but it made clean up alot easier and potentially could have an impact on the taste/cooking of the Protein.
